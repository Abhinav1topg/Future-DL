# Future-DL
Here lie projects related to Machine learning, Deep Learning, Computer vision, Natural language processing

Both the projects use Yolo detection model

1st is an object detection project 
I have provided a file with the code and 2 extra files which contain a video of cars going by a highway and a mask png 
So how it works basically is it will first put a mask over the video so we can apply the code on the ROI 
The mask that I have provided here will only work with this particular video because the ROI will change in every different video

In the second project, I made another detection model but this time for people named "People counter " and a video with people traveling an elevator, I have already provided a mask2 with it as well
